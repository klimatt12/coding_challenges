This is a pretty boring repo focussing on questions that may come up during technical interviews. 
The hope is that these will demonstrate knowledge in several technical areas and allow for more interesting discussions
beyond reversing strings, creating dictionaries, etc.  
Please don't use this as an excuse to ask even harder questions!
